# PortX

An Blockchain-based platform for managing reservations at ports, transparently and efficiently.

## Concept


## Structure

* `client/` - client side code (website) for the portx project
* `server/` - server side code (ledger recording and querying logic) for portx

## Building and running the project

From the `server` folder:
<pre>
    yarn && yarn start
</pre>

From the `client` folder:
<pre>
    yarn && yarn start
</pre>

The app should now be running on port 8000, with the server responding on port 8001.
