      <p>
        PortX provides an online platform for reserving time slots at different ports. Trucking companies can share their intent by placing a reservation (if available) at any of the listed ports. Other companies can see that there's an existing reservation, without having to disclose unecessary identifying information to other parties about who is actually in the specific time slot.
